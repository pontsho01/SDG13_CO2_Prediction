## 🧠 Ethical Reflection

**1. Could there be bias in your dataset?**  
Yes. The dataset might be biased due to uneven reporting between countries, missing data, or outdated statistics. Countries with less monitoring infrastructure may underreport emissions, affecting model accuracy.

**2. Does this model promote fairness and sustainability?**  
Yes. By helping predict CO₂ emissions, this model supports SDG 13 (Climate Action). It helps governments and organizations make better decisions to reduce emissions, especially if combined with energy usage and economic data.

**3. Any potential risks?**  
Yes. Relying solely on the model without understanding local context could lead to unfair regulations or penalties. Ethical AI use requires transparency, human oversight, and fairness checks.

**4. How can it be improved?**  
- Use more diverse and complete data sources  
- Add social and economic impact features  
- Apply fairness metrics to detect prediction bias
